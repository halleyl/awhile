# It's Been Awhile

Enjoy the melodic tones of Staind whenever these magical words appear. This Chrome extension searches for the phrases "it's been awhile" or "it's been a while" in webpage text, highlights them and allows you to click the text to enjoy a short audio clip of the song in question. It's pointless fun!
